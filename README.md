## 📌 Project Status
Hi! This project is currently under development. The mobile version of the Homepage is available, and I'm working on the layout, reusable components, and foundational structure.

🔧 Upcoming features:

Responsive design for larger screens

- Routing with React Router

- Internal views (product, cart, etc.)

- Cart logic and interactive features

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager

📌 If you're using another package manager like npm or yarn, you can still install the dependencies — however, I recommend using pnpm.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/anabella-01/ecommerce-project.git

2. Install dependencies

pnpm install

3. Start the development server

pnpm run dev

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
